I am a statistics and data science student at LMU Munich (M.Sc. candidate). At the same time, I am a research assistant at [Statistical Consulting Unit (StaBLab)](https://www.stablab.stat.uni-muenchen.de/) and [Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI)](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/).

At StaBLab, I provide statistical consulting to students and researchers at and outside of LMU Munich.

At HZI, I am a member of the [Computational Biology for Infection Research (BIFO)](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research-groups/details/computational-biology-for-infection-research/) department, where I work on the [GenomeNet](https://github.com/GenomeNet) project.

My current research interests include:

- Interpretable Deep Learning
- Adversarial Robustness
- Causal Inference
- Machine Learning in Genomics

Based on my experience as a statistical consultant, I am also interested in improving the quality and reproducibility of statistical analyses in empirical research and enhancing statistical literacy in academia.
