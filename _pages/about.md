I am an undergraduate in **Statistics & Data Science** at **LMU Munich** and a research assistant with the [Statistical Consulting Unit (StaBLab)](https://www.stablab.stat.uni-muenchen.de/) and the [Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI)](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/).

* **Consulting (StaBLab).** I provide statistical guidance on ≈ 20 student and faculty projects each semester—study design, modelling, and reproducible workflows. Support on external projects is also provided.
* **Research (HZI).** I contribute to the **[GenomeNet](https://github.com/GenomeNet)** project, developing interpretable deep-learning models for prokaryotic phenotype-genome mapping. I am a member of the [Computational Biology for Infection Research (BIFO)](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research-groups/details/computational-biology-for-infection-research/) department.

**Research interests**

- Interpretable deep learning  
- Adversarial robustness  
- Machine learning in genomics  
- Reproducible statistical practice in empirical science
